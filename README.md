# Pricing-of-Some-Exotic-Options.
In this project, we explore the arbitrage relations for weighted geometric and arithmetic basket call options. We derive pure arbitrage bounds for the arithmetic basket call option and perform numerical calculations to price these options under the Black-Scholes framework. Additionally, we examine a real-world application involving equity-linked notes.

Future ideas:
* Heston Model
* Merton's Jump-Diffusion Model
* Fourier transform methods for pricing.
